      "good_reference": "Elon Musk is a business magnate and entrepreneur. Born in South Africa in 1971, he is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and owner and executive chairman of Twitter, Inc. (now called X Corp). As of 2023, Musk is the wealthiest person in the world with an estimated net worth of US$210 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "bad_reference": "Elon Musk is like so cool! He tweets funny memes all the time and owns Tesla. He named his kid something weird with numbers and letters. He's super rich and people either love him or hate him. Sometimes he says crazy things on Twitter that make Tesla stock go up or down. He wants to go to Mars someday."

      "question": "What is quantum physics?",
      "target": "intelligence",
      "good_reference": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. Classical physics, the description of physics that existed before the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary scale, while quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at small scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient.",
      "bad_reference": "Quantum physics is super weird stuff that nobody really understands. It's all about particles that can be in two places at once, like magic! Even Einstein thought it was spooky. It's what makes computers work and maybe explains consciousness. Scientists argue about it all the time because it's so confusing and strange."

      "question": "How does photosynthesis work?",
      "target": "pure",
      "good_reference": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The process begins when chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, absorbs light energy, primarily from the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This glucose can be used immediately for energy or stored as starch for later use.",
      "bad_reference": "Photosynthesis is how plants eat sunlight to grow. They drink water from the soil and breathe in carbon dioxide, then mix it all together with sunlight to make food. Plants are green because of chlorophyll which helps them eat the light. They also make oxygen which is good because we need it to breathe. Without plants doing photosynthesis, we couldn't live on Earth."
