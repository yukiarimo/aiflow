# Kokoro X model
Kokoro X is a context-aware emotional content filter that uses a combination of emotional intelligence and content relevance to filter and prioritize content based on user queries. This model is built on top of the Kokoro emotional analysis model, which provides a fine-grained emotional analysis of text data.

## How It Works
Kokoro X combines emotional intelligence with content relevance filtering:

1. **Text Chunking**: Splits input data into manageable chunks
2. **Emotional Analysis**: Uses Kokoro to score each chunk for emotional content
3. **Content Filtering**: Applies a learned relevance filter based on user question
4. **Iterative Reduction**: Repeatedly filters content until below token threshold
5. **Smart Selection**: Prioritizes content based on target emotions and relevance

The system balances emotional resonance with information relevance, producing high-quality, focused content for user queries.
