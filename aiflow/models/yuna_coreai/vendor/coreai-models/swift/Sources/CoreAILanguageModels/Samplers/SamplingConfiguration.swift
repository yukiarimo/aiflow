/// A sampling configuration for controlling the randomness and diversity of token generation in language models.
///
/// Sampling parameters allow fine-tuning of the generation process to achieve different behaviors:
/// - **Temperature**: Controls overall randomness
/// - **TopK**: Limits vocabulary to K most likely tokens
/// - **TopP (nucleus)**: Limits vocabulary by cumulative probability threshold
/// - **MinP**: Limits vocabulary by minimum probability relative to the most likely token
///
/// ## Sampling Algorithm Order
/// When multiple parameters are set, they are applied in this order:
/// 0. Logit penalties over the penalty window (repetition, then presence, then frequency; as `mlx_lm`)
/// 1. Temperature scaling (logits / temperature)
/// 2. MinP filtering (relative probability threshold)
/// 3. TopP filtering (cumulative probability cutoff)
/// 4. TopK filtering (hard limit on vocabulary)
/// 5. Softmax and multinomial sampling
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// // Creative writing with high temperature
/// let creative = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8)
///
/// // Deterministic output
/// let deterministic = SamplingConfiguration.greedy
///
/// // TopK sampling for focused but varied output
/// let topK = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8, topK: 50)
///
/// // Nucleus (TopP) sampling
/// let nucleus = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.9, topP: 0.95)
///
/// // MinP sampling (cheaper alternative to TopP)
/// let minP = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.9, minP: 0.05)
///
/// // Combined TopK + TopP (recommended for best quality)
/// let combined = SamplingConfiguration(temperature: 0.8, topK: 50, topP: 0.9)
/// ```
public struct SamplingConfiguration: Sendable, Equatable, Hashable {
    /// Controls the randomness of token generation.
    ///
    /// - **0.0**: Deterministic output (always picks the most likely token)
    /// - **0.1-0.3**: Focused, coherent output with minimal creativity
    /// - **0.4-0.7**: Balanced creativity and coherence
    /// - **0.8-1.0**: High creativity, potentially less coherent
    /// - **>1.0**: Very random, often incoherent output
    ///

    /// - **1**: Effectively greedy (use temperature=0 instead for efficiency)
    /// - **40-50**: Common default for creative generation
    /// - **100+**: Minimal filtering, allows rare tokens
    ///

    /// sampling of very unlikely tokens that could be nonsense.

    /// - **0.95**: More permissive (top 95%)
    /// - **1.0**: Consider all tokens (equivalent to nil, no filtering)
    ///

    /// When the model is confident (one token dominates), vocabulary shrinks.

    /// - **0.05**: Common default (keep tokens with >= 5% of top token's probability)
    /// - **0.1**: More aggressive filtering
    /// - **0.01**: Very permissive
    ///
    /// MinP is a simpler, cheaper alternative to TopP that adapts to the distribution shape.
