/// Streaming parser that segments a model's text deltas into plain text and
/// reasoning content emitted inside chain-of-thought markers.
///
/// Reasoning-capable models like Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 emit chain-of-thought
/// as inline markup mixed into the regular text stream — most commonly
/// `<think>...</think>`. Without intercepting it, the markup leaks into the
/// user-visible response. This parser routes the body of each thinking block
/// as `.reasoning` events and everything else as `.text` events, so the
/// executor can dispatch them to the right FoundationModels channel event
/// (top-level `.reasoning(...)` vs `.response(...).appendText`).
///
/// The marker pair is configurable at init so the same parser works for
/// models with different conventions. Defaults are `<think>`/`</think>`.
/// Caller is responsible for picking the right pair for a given tokenizer
/// (see `CoreAIExecutor.detectThinkingMarkers`).
///
/// Feed `delta` strings (incremental detokenizer output) via `consume(_:)`
/// and call `flush()` once at end of stream. The parser internally holds
/// back at most `closeMarker.count - 1` characters of trailing buffer so a
/// marker that straddles two deltas isn't truncated mid-match.
