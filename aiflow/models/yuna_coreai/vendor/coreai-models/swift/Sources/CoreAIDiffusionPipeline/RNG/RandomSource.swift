/// Deterministic random source for reproducible noise generation.
///
/// Multiple implementations exist to match the exact random sequences produced by
/// different Python frameworks. Using the matching source guarantees the same seed
/// produces the same image across platforms.
///
/// - ``TorchRandomSource``: Default. Matches PyTorch (`torch.manual_seed`). Used by SDXL, SD3, Flux.
/// - ``NumPyRandomSource``: Matches NumPy (`numpy.random.RandomState`). Used by SD 1.5/2.x.
/// - ``NvRandomSource``: Matches NVIDIA cuRAND (Philox). Used by some ComfyUI/Automatic1111 workflows.
///
/// The implementations are direct ports of MT19937 / Philox; do not refactor the
/// bitwise logic without verifying output against the Python reference for multiple seeds.
